# Logic

## Description
For improving and practicing logical skills, users can do exercises like Einstein's riddle, or games like (Killer) Sudoku, Cross sum, and Picture Cross. However, to really practice logical reasoning (and critical thinking), a user has to put such skills into practice, namely in questioning, analyzing and making decisions on both emotional, personal, and impersonal subjects. Rather than create a mindfulness app, or a reflections journal, the point is the analysis of one's thoughts, feelings and perceptions, so this may entail some guided thinking. Focusing on essentials like sensory information, memories, known and unknowns, the guidance is simple and repetitive.
