# Description

## Typing
Standard typing:
1. Following a prompt (regular typing test)
2. Answering a prompt
3. Completing a common task, eg. email or letter

En / Code typing:
1. Following an encoded prompt
   - stranger's code and message
   - stranger's code and user's message
     stranger's message and user's code
   - user's code and message
2. Answering or solving an encoded prompt

Unlike regular typing tests, which require a person to follow a prompt, there may be a difference in how fast a person types when they are thinking, as opposed to copying something they're reading or redoing something they might do often. However, if someone does not often or never writes letters or emails, when the repetitive task is writing an email or letter, this would make the nature of the user's mind and dexterity the same as with following a prompt. The deviation in familiarity could be minimal between something unfamiliar and something remotely familiar.

Coded typing is an additional condition imposing a difference in the user's psychophysical state in that it does not follow regular use of language. Even if a user is accustomed to a code, their first language, presuming it's the language they use most for communication, will have its familiarity, as well as ingrained rules. Codes, even if very familiar, will always be secondary in communication, presuming that the user does not speak or message others in code.
