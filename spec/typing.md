# Typing

## Description
Users type on keyboards under different contexts. The conditions of these contexts affect their state of mind, or rather their current mental processes. Regular typing tests rely on having a user type a text they may or may not be familiar with as they read it. This is different from thinking of an answer, coordinating an answer or solution to a prompt, and transcribing an audio source. Given that regular tests only use typing a read prompt, this indicates the assumption that a person is faster or more consistent when typing what they're reading, but this is unrealistic. Most times when most people are typing, it's not something they're reading.

The mental states identified are then matched to whether the user is typing in a native language or from and to codes like shorthand and programming. One might think that speed and accuracy is not as necessary for shorthand and programming, but given shorthand is often for transcription or notetaking, along with programming, increasing one's speed and accuracy can only help to improve one's capacity for completing their work.
